Jenkins used a cron expression, and the different fields are: 
1 MINUTES Minutes in one hour (0-59)
2 HOURS Hours in one day (0-23)
3 DAYMONTH Day in a month (1-31)
4 MONTH Month in a year (1-12)
5 DAYWEEK Day of the week (0-7) where 0 and 7 are sunday

Explain

Jenkins uses cron expressions to schedule jobs at specific times. A cron expression consists of five fields, each specifying a unit of time for scheduling a job. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the fields and their meanings:

MINUTES (0-59): This field specifies the minute of the hour when the job should run. The value can range from 0 to 59. For example, a value of "5" means the job will run at the 5th minute of the hour.

HOURS (0-23): This field specifies the hour of the day when the job should run. The value can range from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11 PM). For example, "3" means the job will run at 3 AM.

DAYMONTH (1-31): This field specifies the day of the month when the job should run. The value can range from 1 to 31, depending on the month. For example, "15" means the job will run on the 15th day of the month.

MONTH (1-12): This field specifies the month in which the job should run. The value can range from 1 to 12, where 1 represents January, and 12 represents December. For example, "6" means the job will run in June.

DAYWEEK (0-7): This field specifies the day of the week when the job should run. The value can range from 0 to 7, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday. For example, "1" means the job will run on Monday.

Example of a Cron Expression:
A cron expression like 30 3 15 6 * 1 would mean:

Run at 30 minutes past 3 AM (3:30 AM)

On the 15th of June (month 6)

On Monday (since 1 represents Monday).

Special Characters:
* (Asterisk): This means "every" value. For example, * in the minute field means the job runs every minute.

, (Comma): This allows you to specify multiple values. For example, 1,5,10 in the minute field means the job runs at 1, 5, and 10 minutes past the hour.

- (Dash): This specifies a range of values. For example, 1-5 in the hour field means the job runs between 1 AM and 5 AM.

/ (Slash): This specifies a step value. For example, */5 in the minute field means the job runs every 5 minutes.

By combining these, you can create very specific schedules for Jenkins jobs.

Example: 30 14 15 6 1

This would mean:

30: At the 30th minute.

14: At 2 PM (14:00).

15: On the 15th day of the month.

6: In June (month 6).

1: On Monday (since 1 represents Monday).

So, this job would run at 2:30 PM on June 15th, but only if it's a Monday.

Example: 0 12 * * *

This would mean:

0: At the 0th minute (on the hour).

12: At 12 PM (noon).

*: Every day of the month.

*: Every month.

*: Every day of the week.

So, this job would run every day at noon (12:00 PM).




**********

1. "Build periodically" / "Schedule":
In Jenkins, "Build periodically" is used to define when a job should run automatically based on a cron-like schedule. The schedule is defined using cron expressions.

2. Cron Expression: 0 12 * * *:

This cron expression means:

0: Run at the 0th minute of the hour (on the hour).

12: Run at 12 PM (noon).

*: Every day of the month.

*: Every month.

*: Every day of the week.

So, this cron expression will run every day at 12:00 PM (noon).

3. Using H 12 * * * to Spread the Load:

Jenkins provides a feature to spread the load more evenly by adding H (a hash-based distribution) instead of specifying a fixed minute. Using H 12 * * * means that the job will run at some random minute around noon, determined by Jenkins. This helps to avoid all jobs scheduled for exactly 12:00 PM from running at the same time and overloading the system.

H 12 * * *: Jenkins will hash the job name and calculate a minute value (e.g., H could translate to 15 for a particular job), meaning that instead of running at exactly 12:00 PM, it may run at 12:15 PM, 12:30 PM, or some other minute, ensuring better load distribution.

4. What Happens on Wednesday, 26 March 2025, at 12:00 PM IST:
If the last run was at 12:00 PM (India Standard Time) on Wednesday, 26 March 2025, and the cron expression used was 0 12 * * *, the job would indeed run at that exact time.

5. Next Run on Thursday, 27 March 2025, at 12:00 PM IST:
If the cron expression is 0 12 * * *, the next run would happen exactly one day later, at 12:00 PM IST on Thursday, 27 March 2025.

To Summarize:
0 12 * * *: The job runs at 12:00 PM IST every day.

H 12 * * *: The job runs at some random minute around 12:00 PM IST every day, but it will spread the load more evenly across different minutes.

So, if you want to avoid jobs running exactly at noon and potentially overloading your system, you would use H 12 * * * instead of 0 12 * * *.
